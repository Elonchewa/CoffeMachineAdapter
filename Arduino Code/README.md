The project requires that we serve a webpage to a client. This webpage must be hosted on the esp32 (at least that's what we think for now). 
Cofe_website_serving_v1 and v2 are based on connecting the esp32 to a wifi network and then a device on the same network can access the webpage by searching the IP address on a search engine.
However, we haven't been able to test this out (in school) due to school wifi restrictions and inability to connect. However, it works on a regular home or public network.
Our next step is to test if creating a SAP (Soft access point) on the esp32 and then having the phone link to the esp32 directly to recieve the webpage would be better.
That folder will be called Cofe_website_serving_v3.
